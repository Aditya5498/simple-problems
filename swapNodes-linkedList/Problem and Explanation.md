Problem :-

Pairwise Swap Nodes of a given linked list by changing links

Given a singly linked list, write a function to swap elements pairwise. 
For example, if the linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6->7 
then the function should change it to 2->1->4->3->6->5->7, 
and if the linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 
then the function should change it to 2->1->4->3->6->5

Solution :-
make another variable head which is the 2nd node in the list
Swap the pointers of each alternative node and move next
